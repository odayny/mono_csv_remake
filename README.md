# (I have no ficking idea how to call it)

I still using MonoBank and want to track some operations there. 
Unfortunately their CSV statement does not have an anount in specific currency.
So I decided to prepare the CSV before importing it into tracking software.

## Important note

Most of the code is generated by AI (ChatGPT) and comments may or may not have sense there.
In general this repo is just a publick backup for personal use.

## How it works?

1. Opens the csv file.
2. Parses the date from column A
3. Asks exchangeratesapi.io for a EUR-UAH rate in that day (you need a file `api_key.txt` with an API key)
4. Creates a column with a EUR value.
